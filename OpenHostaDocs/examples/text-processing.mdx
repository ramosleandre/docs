## Overview

Text processing is one of the most powerful use cases for OpenHosta. This page demonstrates practical examples of translation, sentiment analysis, text transformation, and more.

<Note>
These examples work with any configured LLM provider - OpenAI, Ollama, Azure, or custom models.
</Note>

## Translation

### Basic Translation

The classic example of AI-powered text processing:

```python
from OpenHosta import emulate

def translate(text: str, language: str) -> str:
    """
    Translate text into the specified language.

    Args:
        text: The text to translate
        language: Target language (e.g., "French", "Spanish", "Japanese")

    Returns:
        The translated text
    """
    return emulate()

result = translate("Hello World!", "French")
print(result)
# Bonjour le monde !
```

### Batch Translation

Process multiple texts in parallel using async:

```python
import asyncio
from OpenHosta.asynchrone import emulate
from typing import List

async def translate(text: str, language: str) -> str:
    """Translate text into the specified language."""
    return await emulate()

async def translate_batch(texts: List[str], language: str) -> List[str]:
    """Translate multiple texts in parallel."""
    tasks = [translate(text, language) for text in texts]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

texts = [
    "Hello, how are you?",
    "The weather is nice today.",
    "I love programming!"
]

results = asyncio.run(translate_batch(texts, "Spanish"))
for original, translated in zip(texts, results):
    print(f"{original} → {translated}")

# Hello, how are you? → Hola, ¿cómo estás?
# The weather is nice today. → El clima está agradable hoy.
# I love programming! → ¡Me encanta programar!
```

### Context-Aware Translation

Maintain context and tone in translations:

```python
from OpenHosta import emulate

def translate_with_context(
    text: str,
    language: str,
    tone: str = "neutral"
) -> str:
    """
    Translate text while preserving the specified tone.

    Args:
        text: The text to translate
        language: Target language
        tone: Desired tone (formal, casual, friendly, professional)

    Returns:
        Translated text with appropriate tone
    """
    return emulate()

formal = translate_with_context(
    "Hey, can you send me that file?",
    "French",
    "formal"
)
print(formal)
# Pourriez-vous m'envoyer ce fichier, s'il vous plaît ?

casual = translate_with_context(
    "Hey, can you send me that file?",
    "French",
    "casual"
)
print(casual)
# Hé, tu peux m'envoyer ce fichier ?
```

## Sentiment Analysis

### Basic Sentiment Detection

Classify text sentiment:

```python
from OpenHosta import emulate
from enum import Enum

class Sentiment(Enum):
    POSITIVE = "positive"
    NEGATIVE = "negative"
    NEUTRAL = "neutral"

def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> Sentiment:
    """
    Analyze the sentiment expressed in the text.

    Args:
        text: Text to analyze

    Returns:
        Sentiment classification
    """
    return emulate()

reviews = [
    "This product is amazing! Best purchase ever!",
    "Terrible quality, broke after one day.",
    "It's okay, nothing special."
]

for review in reviews:
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(review)
    print(f"{review[:40]}... → {sentiment.value}")

# This product is amazing! Best purchase e... → positive
# Terrible quality, broke after one day. → negative
# It's okay, nothing special. → neutral
```

### Detailed Sentiment Analysis

Get more nuanced sentiment information:

```python
from OpenHosta import emulate
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class DetailedSentiment(BaseModel):
    overall: str = Field(description="positive, negative, or neutral")
    confidence: float = Field(description="Confidence score 0-1")
    emotions: list[str] = Field(description="Detected emotions")
    aspects: dict[str, str] = Field(description="Sentiment per aspect")

def analyze_sentiment_detailed(text: str) -> DetailedSentiment:
    """
    Perform detailed sentiment analysis on text.

    Args:
        text: Text to analyze

    Returns:
        Detailed sentiment information including emotions and aspect-based sentiment
    """
    return emulate()

review = """
The camera quality is excellent, and the battery life exceeded my expectations.
However, the user interface is confusing and the customer service was unhelpful.
Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase.
"""

analysis = analyze_sentiment_detailed(review)
print(f"Overall: {analysis.overall} (confidence: {analysis.confidence})")
print(f"Emotions: {', '.join(analysis.emotions)}")
print("Aspects:")
for aspect, sentiment in analysis.aspects.items():
    print(f"  - {aspect}: {sentiment}")

# Overall: positive (confidence: 0.75)
# Emotions: satisfaction, frustration, appreciation
# Aspects:
#   - camera quality: positive
#   - battery life: positive
#   - user interface: negative
#   - customer service: negative
```

## Text Transformation

    """
    return emulate()

result = capitalize_cities("je suis allé à londres et los angeles en juin")
print(result)
# je suis allé à Londres et Los Angeles en juin

def title_case_smart(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Convert text to title case, but keep acronyms and proper nouns as they are.
    """
    return emulate()

result = title_case_smart("the FBI and CIA work in the USA")
print(result)

import asyncio
from OpenHosta.asynchrone import emulate
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class TextAnalysis(BaseModel):
    original: str
    language: str
    sentiment: str
    keywords: List[str]
    summary: str

async def detect_language(text: str) -> str:
    """Detect text language."""
    return await emulate()

async def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> str:
    """Analyze sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)."""
    return await emulate()

async def extract_keywords(text: str) -> List[str]:
    """Extract up to 3 main keywords."""
    return await emulate()

async def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Create a one-sentence summary."""
    return await emulate()

async def analyze_text_complete(text: str) -> TextAnalysis:
    """Run all analyses in parallel."""
    # Execute all analyses simultaneously
    language, sentiment, keywords, summary = await asyncio.gather(
        detect_language(text),
        analyze_sentiment(text),
        extract_keywords(text),
        summarize(text)
    )

    return TextAnalysis(
        original=text,
        language=language,
        sentiment=sentiment,
        keywords=keywords,
        summary=summary
    )

text = """
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity.
Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea level rise threaten
ecosystems and human societies worldwide.
"""

analysis = asyncio.run(analyze_text_complete(text))
print(f"Language: {analysis.language}")
print(f"Sentiment: {analysis.sentiment}")
print(f"Keywords: {', '.join(analysis.keywords)}")
print(f"Summary: {analysis.summary}")

# Language: en
# Sentiment: neutral
# Keywords: climate change, rising temperatures, extreme weather
# Summary: Climate change poses significant threats through temperature rise,
#          extreme weather, and rising sea levels.
```
